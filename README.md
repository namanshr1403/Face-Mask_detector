<h3>FaceMaskDetector Using OpenCV</h3>

Step 1: Dataset Preparation
Gather a dataset of images containing two classes: "with_mask" and "without_mask." This dataset should have images of people wearing face masks and images of people without face masks. The dataset should be divided into training and testing sets.

Step 2: Data Preprocessing
Before training the model, preprocess the dataset. Resize all the images to a fixed size (e.g., 128x128) and normalize the pixel values to a range between 0 and 1. Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

Step 3: Model Training
Build a deep learning model using TensorFlow to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. A popular architecture for this task is Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model should have a series of convolutional and pooling layers to extract features from the input images, followed by fully connected layers for classification. The final layer should have two output nodes representing the "with_mask" and "without_mask" classes.

Step 4: Model Compilation
Compile the model with appropriate loss function and optimizer. For a binary classification problem like this, use binary cross-entropy as the loss function and Adam optimizer.

Step 5: Face Detection
Use OpenCV's pre-trained face detection model to detect faces in real-time video streams or images. You can use Haar cascades or deep learning-based face detectors like Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) or You Only Look Once (YOLO). The detected face regions will be passed to the trained model for classification.

Step 6: Face Mask Classification
For each detected face, pass the face region through the trained TensorFlow model to classify whether it's "with_mask" or "without_mask." The model will output the probabilities of each class, and a threshold can be set to determine the final prediction.
